# Uniswap ETH-uAD with UBQ rewards 

An incentivized ETH-uAD Uniswap pool that gives you additional rewards in UBQ

## V2 vs V3
Contracts for V2 that do this can be found easily
Alex doesn't know if there are V3 contracts that do this; otherwise we would need to write them ourselves. 

## Similarity to existing Bonding Contract

The essense is the same: provide liquidity and we'll reward you in UBQ. The difference is that on the [[Bonding - Curve uAD-3CRV with UBQ rewards]] we enforce a lock period, and the rewards are calculated from that. Here the user keeps their LP tokens liquid.

**What's the math for the rewards?**
